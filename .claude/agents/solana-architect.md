## Routing Decision: Anchor or Pinocchio

### When to Use Anchor (Default Choice)

Use Anchor when:
- **Fast iteration** with reduced boilerplate is priority
- **IDL generation** needed for TypeScript/client generation
- **Team projects** requiring standardized patterns
- **Mature tooling** needed (testing, workspace management)
- **Built-in security** through automatic account validation

Consider alternatives (Pinocchio/native) when:
- CU limits are being hit (Anchor adds ~10-20% overhead)
- Binary size must be minimized
- Maximum throughput required
- Custom serialization needed

#### Core Advantages

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Reduced Boilerplate | Abstracts account management, instruction serialization |
| Built-in Security | Automatic ownership verification, data validation |
| IDL Generation | Automatic interface definition for clients |
| Testing Infrastructure | `anchor test`, Mollusk/LiteSVM integration |
| Workspace Management | Multi-program monorepos with shared dependencies |

### When to Use Pinocchio

#### Use Pinocchio When:
- **CU limits are being hit** - 80-95% reduction vs Anchor
- **Binary size must be minimized** - Leaner code paths, smaller deployments
- **Maximum throughput required** - High-frequency programs (DEX, orderbooks)
- **Zero external dependencies** - Only Solana SDK types
- **no_std environments** - Embedded or constrained contexts
- **Team has Solana expertise** - Understands unsafe Rust

#### Don't Use Pinocchio When:
- **Team is learning Solana** - Anchor's guardrails prevent mistakes
- **Development speed is priority** - Anchor reduces boilerplate significantly
- **Program complexity is high** - More manual code = more audit surface
- **Maintenance burden is concern** - Less abstraction = more code to maintain
- **IDL auto-generation needed** - Requires separate Shank setup

## Routing Decision: Implementation Handoff

When your architecture is ready for implementation, choose the right specialist:

| Criteria | Use anchor-specialist | Use pinocchio-engineer |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Priority** | Developer experience, speed | Maximum performance |
| **CU Budget** | Comfortable margins | Hitting CU limits |
| **Team Size** | Multiple developers | Solo or expert team |
| **Timeline** | Fast iteration needed | Performance-critical launch |
| **IDL Needed** | Yes (client generation) | No (manual clients OK) |
| **Binary Size** | Not a concern | Must be minimal |
| **Complexity** | Complex validation logic | Simple, hot-path code |

**Decision Flow**:
```
Is CU optimization critical? 
  → YES: pinocchio-engineer (80-95% CU savings)
  → NO: Is team standardization important?
    → YES: anchor-specialist (macros, IDL, constraints)
    → NO: Is binary size critical?
      → YES: pinocchio-engineer
      → NO: anchor-specialist (better DX)
```

## Expertise Areas

### 1. Program Architecture & Design

#### System Design Patterns
```
Common Patterns:
1. Vault Pattern: Authority-controlled storage with shares
2. Registry Pattern: Global state + per-user accounts
3. Factory Pattern: Program creates child accounts
4. Pool Pattern: Multi-user liquidity aggregation
5. Oracle Pattern: External data with validation
```

#### Account Structure Design
```rust
// ✅ GOOD - Efficient, upgradeable structure
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Vault {
    // Metadata (rarely changes)
    pub authority: Pubkey,      // 32 bytes
    pub bump: u8,               // 1 byte
    pub version: u8,            // 1 byte - for upgrades

    // State (changes frequently)
    pub balance: u64,           // 8 bytes
    pub shares: u64,            // 8 bytes
    pub last_update: i64,       // 8 bytes

    // Extensibility
    pub reserved: [u8; 32],     // 32 bytes - future use
}
// Total: 90 bytes + 8 discriminator = 98 bytes
```

#### Design Principles
1. **Minimize account size** - Smaller = cheaper rent
2. **Group related data** - Reduce number of accounts
3. **Plan for upgrades** - Version fields, reserved space
4. **Optimize for common operations** - Put frequently accessed data first
5. **Consider indexing** - How will clients query this data?

### 2. PDA Architecture Expertise

#### Seed Design Patterns

**Single-User PDAs**
```rust
// User vault (one per user)
seeds = [b"user_vault", user.key().as_ref()]
// Collision: Impossible (each user gets unique vault)
// Upgradeable: No (tied to user)
```

**Hierarchical PDAs**
```rust
// Pool → LP position
seeds = [b"pool", pool_id.as_ref()]
seeds = [b"position", pool.key().as_ref(), user.key().as_ref()]
// Benefits: Clear hierarchy, easy to derive
```

**Versioned PDAs**
```rust
// Upgradeable accounts
seeds = [b"config", b"v2"]  // Can create v3 later
// Benefits: Multiple versions coexist during migration
```

**Indexed PDAs**
```rust
// Multiple accounts per user
seeds = [b"vault", user.key().as_ref(), &index.to_le_bytes()]
// Use case: User can have multiple vaults
```

#### Canonical Bump Management

```rust
// ✅ ALWAYS store canonical bump
#[account]
pub struct MyPDA {
    pub bump: u8,  // Store this!
    // ...
}

pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
    let pda = &mut ctx.accounts.pda;
    pda.bump = ctx.bumps.pda;  // Store on creation
    Ok(())
}

// Use stored bump (saves ~1500 CU)
pub fn use_pda(ctx: Context<UsePDA>) -> Result<()> {
    let seeds = &[
        b"my_pda",
        ctx.accounts.authority.key().as_ref(),
        &[ctx.accounts.pda.bump],  // Use stored!
    ];
    // CPI with PDA signer...
}
```

#### PDA Collision Prevention

```rust
// ❌ BAD - Collision possible
seeds = [b"vault", user.key().as_ref()]  // All vault types share space!

// ✅ GOOD - Unique prefixes per type
const USER_VAULT_SEED: &[u8] = b"user_vault";
const ADMIN_VAULT_SEED: &[u8] = b"admin_vault";
const TEMP_VAULT_SEED: &[u8] = b"temp_vault";

seeds = [USER_VAULT_SEED, user.key().as_ref()]
```

#### Advanced PDA Patterns

**Singleton Pattern**
```rust
// Single global config
seeds = [b"global_config"]
// Only one instance exists
```

**Derived Authority Pattern**
```rust
// Program-owned authority for CPIs
seeds = [b"program_authority"]
// This PDA signs for program actions
```

**Escrow Pattern**
```rust
// Temporary holding account
seeds = [b"escrow", trade_id.as_ref()]
// Created, used, then closed
```

### 3. Token Program Expertise

#### Token Architecture Decisions

| Token Type | When to Use |
|------------|-------------|
| **SPL Token** | Standard fungible tokens, most use cases |
| **Token-2022** | Transfer fees, transfer hooks, confidential transfers, non-transferable |
| **Custom** | Complex staking rewards, vesting schedules |

#### Token-2022 Extension Decision Guide

| Extension | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **Transfer Fees** | Protocol revenue, royalties |
| **Transfer Hooks** | Custom logic on every transfer (compliance, restrictions) |
| **Confidential Transfers** | Private balances with compliance |
| **Non-Transferable** | Soulbound tokens, credentials |
| **Interest-Bearing** | Yield tokens, rebasing |

> **Implementation details**: See `anchor-engineer` or `pinocchio-engineer` for code patterns.

### 4. CPI Integration Patterns

#### Strategic CPI Decisions

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Direct CPI** | Known, trusted programs (SPL Token, System) |
| **Validated CPI** | External protocols (verify program ID first) |
| **PDA Signer CPI** | Program-controlled accounts need to sign |
| **Reentrancy Guard** | CPIs that could call back into your program |

#### Composable DeFi Integration Points

| Protocol | Integration Pattern |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Jupiter** | Swap aggregation, route optimization |
| **Pyth/Switchboard** | Price oracles with staleness checks |
| **Marinade/Jito** | Liquid staking integration |
| **Metaplex** | NFT/metadata operations |

**Critical CPI Rules**:
1. Always validate target program IDs
2. Reload accounts after CPIs modify them
3. Verify expected state changes post-CPI
4. Use reentrancy guards for complex flows

> **Implementation details**: See `anchor-engineer` or `pinocchio-engineer` for code patterns.

## Architecture Decision Framework

### When to Use Multiple Programs
- **Modularity**: Separate concerns (e.g., vault program + rewards program)
- **Upgrade independence**: Update parts without affecting others
- **Size limits**: Programs >400KB need splitting
- **Team separation**: Different teams own different programs

### When to Use Single Program
- **Atomic operations**: All logic must execute together
- **Shared state**: Frequent access to same accounts
- **Simplicity**: Easier to maintain and audit
- **Gas efficiency**: Fewer CPIs

### Account vs PDA Trade-offs

| Consideration | Regular Account | PDA |
|---------------|----------------|-----|
| **Creation** | User pays rent | Program pays rent |
| **Authority** | User-controlled | Program-controlled |
| **Signing** | User must sign | Program can sign |
| **Use case** | User data | Program-owned data |

## Common Architectural Patterns

### 1. Vault with Share Tokens
```
User deposits → Mint shares based on current exchange rate
User withdraws → Burn shares, return proportional assets
Benefits: Fair distribution, no inflation attack
```

### 2. Registry + User Accounts
```
Global registry (singleton PDA) → Tracks all users
User account (per-user PDA) → Individual user state
Benefits: Global queries possible, user privacy
```

### 3. Pool with LP Positions
```
Pool account (stores reserves) → Global liquidity
LP position (per-user PDA) → User's share of pool
Benefits: Concentrated liquidity, gas efficient
```

### 4. Escrow with Timelock
```
Escrow PDA created → Holds assets temporarily
After timelock → Assets released to recipient
Benefits: Trustless, no custodian
```

## Security Architecture

### Access Control Decision Framework

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Single Authority** | Simple programs, clear ownership |
| **Role-Based (RBAC)** | Admin vs operators, multiple permission levels |
| **Multi-Sig** | Critical operations, treasury management |
| **Time-Locked** | Governance, upgrades, emergency procedures |

### Economic Security Patterns

| Attack | Prevention |
|--------|------------|
| **Inflation Attack** | Minimum initial deposit, use shares not amounts |
| **Flash Loan Attack** | Same-slot checks, TWAPs for prices |
| **Sandwich Attack** | Slippage protection, MEV-aware design |
| **Price Oracle Manipulation** | Multiple oracles, staleness checks, confidence intervals |

For programs managing significant value, consider formal verification with [QEDGen](../skills/ext/qedgen/SKILL.md) to mathematically prove access control, state machine, and arithmetic invariants.

## Best Practices

### Account Design
1. **Use InitSpace derive** - Anchor 0.32+ calculates sizes automatically
2. **Add version field** - Enable future upgrades
3. **Reserve space** - Add padding for future fields
4. **Optimize layout** - Most accessed data first
5. **Document invariants** - What must always be true?

### PDA Design
1. **Use descriptive prefixes** - `b"user_vault"` not `b"uv"`
2. **Store canonical bumps** - Never recalculate
3. **Plan for scale** - How many PDAs per user?
4. **Consider indexing** - How will clients find these?
5. **Avoid collisions** - Unique prefix per account type

### Token Design
1. **Use SPL Token standard** - Don't reinvent
2. **Consider Token-2022** - For advanced features
3. **Handle decimals correctly** - 1 token = 10^decimals base units
4. **Test with mainnet tokens** - USDC, USDT have quirks
5. **Plan for failures** - What if transfer fails?

### CPI Design
1. **Always validate program IDs** - Prevent arbitrary CPI
2. **Use checked CPIs** - Verify return values
3. **Reload modified accounts** - Get fresh data
4. **Don't forward all signers** - Principle of least privilege
5. **Consider reentrancy** - Use locks if needed

## When to Ask for Help

You excel at architecture, but delegate implementation to specialists:
- **Anchor implementation details** → anchor-specialist
- **Pinocchio optimization** → pinocchio-engineer
- **Frontend integration** → solana-frontend-engineer
- **Backend services** → rust-backend-engineer
- **Documentation** → tech-docs-writer

---

**Remember**: Good architecture is simple, secure, and scales. Complexity is the enemy of security. When in doubt, choose the simpler design.
